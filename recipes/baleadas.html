    <h3>A typical Honduran Baleada, popular among toursits.</h3>
    <p>The Honduran "Baleada" is the unofficial national dish of the Republic of Honduras.</p>
    <p>Most often confused by toursits as a "burrito", this dish differs from your typical californian dish by being the only vegetarian friendly option in a sea of meat-filled dishes in this Central American nation.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients: </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A pack of flour tortillas</li>
        <li>An avocado</li>
        <li>2-3 eggs</li>
        <li>Re-fried beans</li>
        <li>Fried plantains</li>

    </ul>

        <p>
            <em>The steps part assumes you have a pan and a stove, with at least a spatula.</em>
        </p>
        <li>First, start your stove to medium heat, place your pan and let it heat for about 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Then add one flour tortilla first and heat each side for at least 2 minutes (less if you see it necessary).</li>
        <li>When you feel your tortillas warm and toasty, place them aside for a while.</li>
        <li>Make scrambled eggs and season them with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>After your eggs are done, place the eggs in a seperate serving plate.</li>
        <li>Open your refried bean bag or can and cook them in a stove, after 5 minutes of adding water and cooking, place them in a seperate serving bowl.</li>
        <li>Place the already prepared fried plantains and Mantequilla into seperate bowls too.</li>
        <li>After preparing all of the toppings start assembling your baleadas.</li>
        <li>Lay some refried bean spread into a tortilla and start laying your ingredients one by one, making sure to leave the mantequilla as the last topping.</li>
