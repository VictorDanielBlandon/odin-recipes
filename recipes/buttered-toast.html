            <em>The steps part assumes you have a pan, a stove and a butter knife.</em>

        <li>First, start your stove to medium heat, place your pan and let it heat for about 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Then open the butter package, get the butter knife and add as much butter as you want on one side of the bread.</li>
