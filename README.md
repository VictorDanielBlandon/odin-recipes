In this project I'll be creating a small brutalist-style website as a start in my journey in web development.

I'll be demonstrating my first insights in becoming proficient in computer programming and simple program creation.

I will also be demonstrating my knowledge in the basics of the use of git and github, as I'll be creating small commits and demonstrating the changes of my work in my assignment.
